        As more countries extend voting rights to citizens residing abroad,
        diaspora communities play a growing role in home country politics. Within
        the last 30 years, voting rights for citizens residing abroad have been
        adopted by the majority of countries in the world, yet voting rates among
        diaspora communities are almost universally low. Transnational campaigning
        shows parties from around the world seek support from citizens residing
        abroad despite the fact that they usually do not, and sometimes cannot
        legally vote, and parties are sometimes legally restricted from campaigning
        abroad. Yet parties’ diaspora outreach efforts are not uniform. This study
        finds that the intensity and type of engagement by which parties court
        migrants vary widely, and are largely shaped by a factor I call Diaspora
        Skew, the legacy of negative partisanship by diaspora communities against
        the party in power during the initial period of large-scale migration.
        Using original data on party travel documents, surveys of both migrants
        and home country voters, and interviews with politicians, party officials,
        and campaign strategists, I examine diaspora campaigning by parties in the
        top three migrant-sending countries to the U.S. relative to population:
        Mexico, El Salvador, and the Dominican Republic. My findings show that
        party investment in building overseas infrastructure, and engaging in
        grassroots mobilization, depends on this legacy of diaspora skew, as
        diasporas’ political profiles can become frozen in time and diverge from
        the home country electorate. I also find that politicians seek the support
        of migrants not primarily for their votes, but for the influence they
        believe migrants have over family members in their home countries. As one
        Salvadoran party activist states, “If we get the support of one Salvadoran
        in the U.S., that gives us five votes in El Salvador.” My statistical
        models on political behavior of migrants’ relatives, however, finds this
        perception to be exaggerated.
