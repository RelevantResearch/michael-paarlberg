## Voting Rights and Diaspora Engagement

Over the last 30 years, the majority of countries worldwide have adopted voting rights for citizens residing abroad. Political parties frequently seek support from these communities, even though many diasporas either cannot or do not legally vote. Interestingly, parties are sometimes legally restricted from campaigning abroad, yet they continue to engage with diaspora communities in various ways.

## Research Focus: Diaspora Skew and Political Outreach

My research examines the intensity and type of engagement that political parties use to court migrant communities. A central concept I introduce is “Diaspora Skew,” which refers to the legacy of negative partisanship by diaspora communities against the ruling party during periods of large-scale migration. This skew significantly shapes how parties engage with diaspora communities, leading to varied outreach efforts.

## Case Studies: Mexico, El Salvador, and the Dominican Republic

Using original data, surveys, and interviews, I analyze diaspora campaigning by parties from Mexico, El Salvador, and the Dominican Republic—the top three migrant-sending countries to the U.S. relative to population. My findings indicate that party investment in building overseas infrastructure and grassroots mobilization depends on this legacy of diaspora skew, as the political profiles of these communities can become “frozen in time” and diverge from the home country electorate.

## Key Findings: The Influence of Migrants Beyond Voting

A significant discovery in my research is that politicians seek the support of migrants not just for their potential votes but for the influence they have over their family members in their home countries. As one Salvadoran party activist put it, “If we get the support of one Salvadoran in the U.S., that gives us five votes in El Salvador.” However, my statistical models on the political behavior of migrants’ relatives suggest that this perception may be exaggerated.
