### Color and Font

- Michael does not want to use Georgetown University colors and he does not want to use the yellow from his current website
- We should come up with suggestions for design, feel free to try something interesting and we can suggest it! He wants something professional. This includes fonts. Let's try an interesting combination of fonts, text color, and background color!

## Domain

Michael already owns michaelpaarlberg.org through GoDaddy.

## Hand-off

Michael says that he wants to learn how to update the website himself. He is already familiar with Markdown so I think we can teach him how to do it once it's live.
